## KQOL
___
Kerillian's Quality of Life mod. Adds random garbage that I wanted and use for my Videos.

___

#### Quick Switch

___

#### Auto Skip
Automatically skip skippable cutscenes. I'd recommend only using this one after beating the game.<br>
**DISABLED BY DEFAULT BECAUSE IT CAN SKIP STORY CUTSCENES, YOU HAVE BEEN WARNED.**

## Config location?
___
It's going to be in your BepInEx config folder, if BRC is installed on C it will be here:</br>
`C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\BombRushCyberfunk\BepInEx\config\Kerillian.QOL.cfg`

## Have an idea?
___
Go ahead and make an issue. If the idea is solid and I'm feeling up to the task I might add it.
